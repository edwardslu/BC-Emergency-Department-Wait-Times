# BC Emergency Department Wait Time Tracker

This project was designed to add functionality to the existing official wait times tracker by "https://www.edwaittimes.ca/". Features I plan to add eventually include historical wait time charts and comparisons between different emergency departments.

API data is retrieved from "https://edwaittimes.ca/api/wait-times".
